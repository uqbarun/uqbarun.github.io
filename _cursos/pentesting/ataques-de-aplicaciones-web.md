# Ataques de aplicaciones web

In this module, we will focus on the identification and exploitation of common web application
vulnerabilities. Modern development frameworks and hosting solutions have simplified the
process of building and deploying web-based applications. However, these applications usually
expose a large attack surface because of a lack of mature application code, multiple
dependencies, and insecure server configurations.
Web applications can be written in a variety of programming languages and frameworks, each of
which can introduce specific types of vulnerabilities. However, the most common vulnerabilities
are similar in concept, regardless of the underlying technology stack.
In this module, we will discuss web application vulnerability enumeration and exploitation.
Although the complexity of vulnerabilities and attacks vary, we will demonstrate the exploitation
of several common web application vulnerabilities listed in the OWASP Top 10 list. 237 These
attack vectors will serve as the basic building blocks used to construct more advanced attacks.
