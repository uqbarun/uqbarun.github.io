## Syllabus

In this module, we focused on the identification and enumeration of common web application
vulnerabilities. We also exploited several common web application vulnerabilities, leveraging a
variety of techniques including admin console weaknesses, cross-site scripting, directory
traversal, local and remote file inclusion, and SQL injection. These attack vectors are the basic
building blocks we will use to construct more advanced attacks.
